        <h1>How Citizens Engage with Climate Authorities on Social Media</h1>
       
        <p>This page brings together all the materials related to the study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-023-00080-3">"How citizens engage with the social media presence of climate authorities: the case of five Brazilian cities"</a>, by Lesandro Ponciano. It includes datasets, dissemination materials, a podcast video, and more—designed for students, researchers, and anyone interested in digital engagement and climate resilience.</p>

        <h2>Main Research Article</h2>
            <p> The research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-023-00080-3" target="_blank">"How citizens engage with the social media presence of climate authorities: the case of five Brazilian cities"</a> is published in </strong> <em>npj Climate Action</em>(Nature Portfolio). It explores citizen interactions with climate authorities on social media in five Brazilian cities, especially during extreme weather events. Using social media analysis, meteorological data, and qualitative methods, it examines how digital platforms shape climate communication. The findings highlight engagement patterns that promote awareness and preparedness, showing how online exchanges between citizens and officials can strengthen community resilience in the face of climate challenges. Some of the main results are discussed below:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Authorities rely on passive posting</strong> Local climate authorities mainly use social media for one-way communication, posting meteorological, hydrological, and geological alerts, forecasts, and weather updates without actively engaging citizens.</li>
		<li><strong>Citizen engagement is short-term and reactive.</strong> Most replies from citizens are immediate and transient, focusing on specific events rather than sustained interaction over time. Long-term engagement is rare.</li>
		<li><strong>Replies focus on corrections and additions, not climate change links.</strong> Citizens often correct inaccuracies, add local observations, or provide updates, but they rarely connect weather events to broader climate change phenomena.</li>
		<li><strong>Limited two-way communication</strong> Despite social media’s interactive nature, authorities seldom reply to citizens. Mentions are mostly directed at other government agencies rather than individuals, reinforcing a single-loop communication style.</li>
		<li><strong>Engagement patterns mirror broader online participation inequality.</strong> A small number of citizens contribute many replies, while most participate minimally or not at all. This reflects the “long-tail” distribution typical of online communities.</li>
		</ul>
	
        <h2>Research Datasets</h2>
