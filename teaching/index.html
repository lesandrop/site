<h2> A short Q/A about Lesandro Ponciano teaching perspective</h2>
<h3> How did I become a Professor?</h3>
<p>In November 2015, I defended my doctoral thesis. In Brazil, it is a natural path to work as a Professor at a university after a doctorate. That is how I started teaching in Information Systems and Software Engineering and Computer Science 
in early 2016. My professorship started in the beginning of 2017. I took a break to do my post-doctorate. I try to balance teaching activities with research activities whenever possible.</p>

<h3>What is the importance of teaching?</h3>

<p>There are several perspectives that I can adopt to answer a question like this. One perspective is its importance to society. Another is its importance to each student individually. In addition, there is its importance to me, as an individual. I believe that I do an important job for society by contributing to the education of people who can perform a technical function, but also have a social conscience. I am sure that I have already contributed to the life stories of many students. The contribution is small; often it is to point out the most correct path, avoid shortcuts and inappropriate behaviour, and commit to everything that one sets out to do. I also learn a lot from teaching. Each student is a story. Each class has its own characteristics and always leads me to new thoughts and new challenges. Teaching also feeds me in terms of research. I always try to bring to the classroom the latest scientific discoveries in the areas in which I teach. </p>

<p> In this context, I suggest some research projects were carried out associated with teaching activities. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lesandrop">Youtube Channel lesandrop</a>, I organise some material that I produce or gather for teaching activity, as well as some vídeos from my students. Examples of research projects are the use of GitHub Classroom, IHC support card and Structured Debate. Here <a href="https://lesandrop.github.io/site/papers/index.html">in this site you can find a complete list of my research projects and publications</a>, including those on education.</p>

<h3>What will I be happy if my students achieve?</h3>

<p>First, that they are happy with what they choose to do. That they are committed professionals and know their importance not only for the organisations in which they work or lead, but for the society around them. There is always the risk of getting carried away by the excessive shine of technology or money that sometimes makes us put it before the needs of people. I believe a good professional must be careful  every day so as not to be seduced by this sort of thing.</p>

<p>In the context of this question, I suggest a <a href="https://lesandrop.github.io/site/history/discursoDeParaninfoSI20211PUCMinas.html">speech I gave at the commencement ceremony for a class I taught</a> (in Portuguese).</p>
